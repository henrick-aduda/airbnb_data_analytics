    "The above plot shows a comparison of common amenities in Cape town and Gauteng, South Africa. There seems to be a similar trend in frequency of common amenities in listings in both cities. The most common amenities in both cities are : Long term stays allowed, TV, Essentials and Free parking. I also noted that generally Cape Town seems to have more occurences of amenities than Gauteng i.e **Cape town has more amenities popping up accross the listings data than Guateng.** I thought perhaps this could be attributed to the population of the cities. My hypothesis was: **cities that have a larger population most likely have more airbnb hosts listings than cities with small populations.** However that was not the case. As per statistics from https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities , Guateng has a population of 5,926,668 while Cape town has a population of 4,709,990 as of 2021. The most likely reason may be the average income of individuals (purchasing power). This requires further research. However due to time constraints I did not analyse this further.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally it seems that amenities that would most likely provide comfort (breakfast, hot tub, air conditioning) are the least common among airbnb host listings data in both cities."
